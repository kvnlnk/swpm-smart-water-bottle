# SWPM - Smart Water Bottle
An intelligent water bottle system for monitoring and promoting healthy drinking habits. 

## Project Overview
The Smart Water Bottle System consists of an ESP32-based hardware solution with flow sensor and display, a backend for data management and user analysis, plus a frontend for android phones created with Flutter.


### Main Features

- **Automatic Water Volume Detection** via flow sensor
- **Visual Feedback** through round TFT display (240x240px)
- **Smart Reminders** with color-coded LEDs
- **Bluetooth Communication** between hardware and backend
- **User Profiles** with individual daily goals
- **Daily Summaries** and progress tracking
- **Cross-Platform Mobile App** for Android
- **Real-time Hardware Sync** via Bluetooth Low Energy
- **Interactive Dashboard** with progress visualization and quick actions
- **Detailed Analytics** with daily charts

## Development
### Prerequisites
